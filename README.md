## Hey!!

I'm Michael and I'm currently an undergrad at Northeastern studying CS.

I started out primarily building janky frontend creations in middle and high school before exploring the full stack all using JavaScript primarily. I quickly started picking up many libraries that made JavaScript and web dev less horrible including Node.js/Express, Tailwind, React, and more. I then realized that JavaScript is a pretty bad language, so I turned to another ~~bad~~ great language Python where I learned more backend frameworks including Flask and FastAPI. Using Python, however, gave me more power, so I started touring file system manipuation and data management for building machine learning models.

Currently, I'm focused on more modern technology, including AI integration, cloud computing (AWS), ML with computer vision and object detection, and mobile app development (primarily Swift). I'm particularily interested in learning more about leveraging AI agents, tailoring ML models, and studying UI/UX exploitation in both websites and mobile apps.

Outside of being a dev, I enjoy lifting, biking, and playing basketball, ice hockey, and volleyball. I'm also an avid foodie - I love to travel to discover new cuisines and great food around the world. I frequently attend networking events in the Boston and greater Boston region. I'd love to chat!
